# {{PLUGIN_NAME}}

> LightSpeed WordPress block plugin starter — lean, block-ready, AI-workflow-aware.

---

## What this repo is

A production-aware starter template for building custom WordPress plugins at LightSpeed.
It is **not** a WordPress.org submission starter and does not include submission-specific bureaucracy.

It is intentionally lighter than `block-plugin-scaffold` while still providing:

- a valid WordPress plugin skeleton
- a block-ready folder structure
- practical PHP and JS linting and validation
- AI-ready workflows with prompts, reports, tasks, and agent personas
- clear placeholder conventions throughout

---

## Who it is for

LightSpeed developers building custom WordPress plugins — for client and commercial work.
Also suitable for use by AI agents working within a structured, well-documented repo.

---

## What it includes

| Area | Description |
|---|---|
| `{{PLUGIN_SLUG}}.php` | Main plugin bootstrap file |
| `uninstall.php` | Safe plugin uninstall stub |
| `inc/` | Optional PHP include files |
| `src/` | Source files for block and plugin assets |
| `blocks/` | Built or registered block asset directories |
| `assets/` | Static CSS, JS, images, and icons |
| `patterns/` | WordPress block patterns |
| `templates/` | Optional block templates |
| `languages/` | Translation files |
| `docs/` | End-user documentation |
| `.github/` | GitHub-native AI and workflow infrastructure |
| `.agents/` | Portable agent skills and personas |

---

## Requirements

- PHP 8.0+
- WordPress 6.4+
- Node.js 20+ (see `.nvmrc`)
- Composer

---

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Use this template via GitHub (recommended):
#    Click "Use this template" on the GitHub repo page,
#    or clone and replace placeholders manually:
git clone https://github.com/{{GITHUB_ORG}}/{{REPO_NAME}}.git my-plugin
cd my-plugin

# 2. Replace all {{PLACEHOLDER}} tokens (see Customise placeholders below)
#    Rename {{PLUGIN_SLUG}}.php to match your actual plugin slug.

# 3. Install Node dependencies
npm install

# 4. Install Composer dependencies
composer install

# 5. Validate the plugin scaffold
npm run plugin:validate

# 6. Lint your code
npm run lint
composer run phpcs
```

---

## Customise placeholders

Search and replace these tokens across the entire repo before starting work:

| Placeholder | Example value |
|---|---|
| `{{PLUGIN_NAME}}` | `My Awesome Plugin` |
| `{{PLUGIN_SLUG}}` | `my-awesome-plugin` |
| `{{TEXT_DOMAIN}}` | `my-awesome-plugin` |
| `{{PLUGIN_URI}}` | `https://example.com/plugins/my-awesome-plugin` |
| `{{PLUGIN_DESCRIPTION}}` | `A useful WordPress plugin.` |
| `{{AUTHOR_NAME}}` | `LightSpeed` |
| `{{AUTHOR_URI}}` | `https://lightspeedwp.agency` |
| `{{NAMESPACE}}` | `MY_AWESOME_PLUGIN` (used only in the `@package` docblock tag) |
| `{{REPO_NAME}}` | `my-awesome-plugin` |
| `{{GITHUB_ORG}}` | `lightspeedwp` |

PHP identifiers (function names, `defined()` constants) are not tokenised — they ship with the fixed
placeholder convention `ls_starter_` (functions) / `LS_STARTER_` (constants), e.g. `ls_starter_init()`,
`LS_STARTER_VERSION`. Scaffolding tooling replaces these prefixes with your real project prefix at
generation time; there is no `{{ }}` token to search and replace for them.

The `name` field in `package.json` and `composer.json` ships with a valid default (not a placeholder) — update it when scaffolding, no token to search and replace.

Also rename `{{PLUGIN_SLUG}}.php` to match your actual plugin slug.
